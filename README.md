The Labyrinth Lord Advanced Companion Thief Character Generator Version 2 is the second iteration of the Advanced Companion Thief Character Generator, and build upon the Basic/Expert Labyrinth Lord Thief Generator Version 2 (https://github.com/mark-tasaka/PHP-Labyrinth-Lord-Thief-Generator-v2). This generator uses Goblinoid Games' Labyrinth Lord Advanced Companion ruleset to randomly generate characters, and contains optional features (i.e., species) for character generation.
